# JWTTokenImplementation

Description: This project implements secure authentication and authorization for a Web API using JSON Web Token (JWT). The implementation involves issuing a signed JWT upon successful user login, which is then used to authenticate subsequent API requests.

Key Features:

User Authentication: Users are verified with their credentials, and upon successful validation, a JWT is issued.

Token Generation: The JWT is generated with a private signing key and includes claims like user ID, roles, and expiration time.

Token Validation: Incoming API requests are validated by checking the token's signature and expiry.

Middleware Integration: The API pipeline includes middleware for token validation and claims extraction.

Technologies Used:

ASP.NET Core Web API

JWT Libraries for Token Signing/Validation

Secure Key Storage (e.g., Environment Variables or Azure Key Vault)

Use Case: This implementation is ideal for securing RESTful APIs by authenticating clients and protecting routes from unauthorized access.
